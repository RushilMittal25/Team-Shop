Project Overview:

Problem:
Nowadays there are a lot of trends to keep up with and brands to keep an eye out
for. Many people have their differences and preferences when it comes to style,
price, clothing, and fit. With that being said, it is hard to find a product at a
reasonable price that fits all these unique preferences. Most online stores do
provide a filtration system but there is not one universal application that takes all
stores and brands into account that can then provide suggestions to the user on
what to buy based on their preferences. This leads to buyers being put in a tough
spot and not being able to find a good quality product at the price they are
looking for.

Solution:
Our solution is to provide an application that uses AI/ML algorithms to offer
product recommendations based on what the user filters. Our application allows
for a user to login and input their personal information such as height and
weight. The user is then provided with certain filters such as clothing style,
brand, size, price, and clothing type. After going through these filters the user is
then provided with numerous recommendations sorted from lowest to highest
price that the user can click onto. By clicking on a product the user is taken to the
product page where they can then get it delivered to their house or go in store to
buy.
